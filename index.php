        A strong password is a fundamental element of online security, serving as the first line of 
        defense against unauthorized access to personal and sensitive information. In an era dominated
        by digital interactions, where individuals store vast amounts of personal data online, the 
        significance of a robust password cannot be overstated. One primary reason for maintaining
        a strong password is the prevalence of cyber threats, including hacking, phishing, and brute force attacks.
